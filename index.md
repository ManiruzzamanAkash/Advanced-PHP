## About Me :
I'm Maniruzzaman Akash. Studying in a university in Bangladesh, named [Patuakhali Science And Technology University](https://pstu.ac.bd). I'm a programmer who crashed on PHP's all of the dynamic syntax's. It's totally a cool language. For making something big project or any web application so much easily..

PHP's object oriented feature is more structured and that is awesome.

So man..wait for my lecture and I'll share everything, what is known to me. And you can ask me any question....
